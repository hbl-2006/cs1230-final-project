CSCI 1230 Final Project--Bailing Hou, Ignas Karvelis, Ross Williams

**Instructions**

For our final render, we specifically worked around the scenefile `tower_10_units.json`, which contains our tower (unsurprisingly).

To turn on our physics features, press "G" to activate the world-level forces (this is gravity and drag in our simulation). To start the explosion, press "O". "O" applies an impulse to two shapes somewhere in the middle of the tower, and causes the explosion. "O" also enables our particle effects, so you'll see dust and fire when the objects hit the floor.

To turn on our camera path, press "P".

To turn on and off our texture mapping features, use the Extra Credit checkboxes.
