# Instructions

For our final render, we specifically worked around the scenefile `scenefiles/tower_10_units.json`, which contains our tower (unsurprisingly).

To turn on our physics features, press `G` to activate the world-level forces (this is gravity and drag in our simulation). To start the explosion, press `O`. `O` applies an impulse to two shapes somewhere in the middle of the tower, and causes the explosion. `O` also enables our particle effects, so you'll see dust and fire when the objects hit the floor.

To turn on and off our camera path, press `P` anytime.

To turn on and off our texture mapping features, use all 4 of the Extra Credit checkboxes.
